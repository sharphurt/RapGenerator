[Intro:]
Look.. If you had..
One shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted.. In one moment
Would you capture it.. Or just let it slip? Yo..

[Verse 1:]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's chokin, how? Everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out, time's up, over — blaow!
Snap back to reality, ohh — there goes gravity
Ohh — there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't
Give up that easy nope, he won't have it
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rap shit
He better go capture this moment
And hope it don't pass him

[Chorus: 2x]
You better — lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better...

[Verse 2:]
Soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move
Toward a new world order
A normal life is boring but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, god only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on da-da-dum da-dum da-dah

[Chorus: 2x]
You better — lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better...

[Verse 3:]
No more games,
I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, cause man, these god damn
Food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein a father and a primadonna
Baby momma drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin option, failure's not
Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus: 2x]
You better — lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better...

[Outro:]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
